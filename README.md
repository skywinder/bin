#bin
##My personal helper-scripts.

---
###To intall:
- `cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/skywinder/bin.git`

- And don't forget to add this path to your **.bashrc/.zshrc/\*rc** file:
`export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin`

---
##Desctiption:

- **`xopen`** - to open workspace or xcode project in the current directory in XCode. Just go to directory and type `xopen`

- **`aopen`** - same thing, but for lovely **AppCode**.


- **`wolcmd`** - Wake On Lan Command Line

*Usage: wolcmd [mac address] [ipaddress] [subnet mask] [port number]*

i.e. wolcmd 009027a322fc 195.188.159.20 255.255.255.0 4343

`appcode` - Just a support file to `aopen` -autogenerated python file from AppCode to run them.
